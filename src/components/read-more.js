        I actually met Folayemi, on X formerly called Twitter, I actually hardly
        interact on X, all I do is to scroll and just like and retweet posts
        when need be. The first time I would ever know her was in December 2022,
        when she made a viral post about her former classmate needing financial
        support on X, the post went viral, I saw it retweeted and scrolled past
        as usual. Few days later she made a post on X, as at this time I was not
        following her, yet the posts were coming to my TL, so this post had a
        caption like â€œshe and her mum" it caught my attention especially seeing
        the mum was young too and they were both beautiful. Unknown to me it was
        her dear Pastor she was referring to as mum, but anyway it got me to
        actually go through her TL, while doing that, I saw it was the same lady
        I saw her post for her classmate around a week ago, while on her TL, a
        small voice from my inside said "she is going to be your wife?" I
        dismissed it of course that it was my mind that saw a beautiful damsel
        and was misbehaving, so I only just followed her, and I was so sure that
        it would just be me and my normal behavior on X that I donâ€™t chat nor
        interact with anyone on X. After some days again on the 6th of January
        2023, she made another tweet about wanting to go see a movie and wanting
        to go with any of her followers, meanwhile this was same movie I had
        planned to go see, see the link to the tweet:

        I ignored the post initially, but inside of me I wasn't settled, I knew
        I had to respond and signal my interest to the post, but typical me
        doesnâ€™t engage posts on X, so to dismiss it quickly, I scrolled past,
        and said if it comes my way on my timeline again, maybe this time I
        would signal my interest also many people had already signaled interest
        in going to see it with her; that even made me dismiss the post quickly
        even more knowing it would have been sorted before I log in back to X.
        Eventually the next day when I went back on X, the same post again on my
        TL, saying that she is still open to going to see the movie with her
        mutuals, more like God was insisting on the matter for me.ðŸ˜ƒ So I
        decided to signal my interest in going to see the movie too, I was
        staying in the Outskirts of Lagos then, so inside of me, so I was so
        sure that distance would be a barrier or me not even having the time
        would be a barrier to us seeing the movie together. See my response
        here:{" "}

        She responded, and we took it to the DM, and surprisingly again, her
        parents stay close to mine and came home for the festive period to see
        her parents and her schedule was perfect for me too. Co-incidence?
        Maybe. We crossed that hurdle. Also remember that she posted going to
        see the movie on her TL, so I was thinking we would have other people
        going to see the movie with us, since many people signaled their
        interest in response to the tweet. But I was fine with seeing the movie
        with the company of other guys, so I asked her, and she said it was just
        two of us that would be seeing the movie, others who signaled interest
        had one hindrance or another, so they weren't chanced. Another
        Co-incidence, maybe not. Eventually we saw the movie together on the 7th
        of January, and we took it from there and started talking from casual
        talks to serious talks even long night calls. I knew already that she
        was the one. With every sign that God gave even with me trying to avoid
        and discard everything was just aligning and confirmation from God's
        word, I knew it was God's will for me, so no time I met with her
        pastors, made the intention known, made it known to her too, and we took
        from there in March to where we are now. Another interesting thing about
        this journey was the date we first interacted was the 6th of January
        2023, my work anniversary date is 6th of January, her work anniversary
        is also the 6th of January, our introduction was the 6th of January
        also. And all these just happened without us even knowing, definitely
        not another Co-incidence, it was just God creating this beautiful love
        story. This was how we met, and the journey has been splendid so far,
        and of course I am ready to do life with you my baby to forever.
